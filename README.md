## Features of C Language
# Simple (C is a simple language in the sense that it provides a structured approach (to break the problem into parts), the rich set of library functions, data types, etc.)

# Machine Independent or Portable (Unlike assembly language, c programs can be executed on different machines with some machine specific changes. Therefore, C is a machine independent language.)

# Mid-level programming language (Although, C is intended to do low-level programming. It is used to develop system applications such as kernel, driver, etc. It also supports the features of a high-level language. That is why it is known as mid-level language.)

# structured programming language(C is a structured programming language in the sense that we can break the program into parts using functions. So, it is easy to understand and modify. Functions also provide code reusability.)

# Rich Library (C provides a lot of inbuilt functions that make the development fast.)

# Memory Management (It supports the feature of dynamic memory allocation. In C language, we can free the allocated memory at any time by calling the free() function.)

# Fast Speed(The compilation and execution time of C language is fast since there are lesser inbuilt functions and hence the lesser overhead.)

# Pointers (C provides the feature of pointers. We can directly interact with the memory by using the pointers. We can use pointers for memory, structures, functions, array, etc.)

# Recursion (In C, we can call the function within the function. It provides code reusability for every function. Recursion enables us to use the approach of backtracking.)

# Extensible (C language is extensible because it can easily adopt new features.)
